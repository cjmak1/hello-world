Hello Humans!

Describing my World


The caterpillar is the prisoner to the streets that conceived him. His only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from its mass city.  While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive. One thing he notices is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly. The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar. By having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp into his own benefits. Always surrounded by this mass city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him. He can no longer see past his own thoughts. He is trapped.  By trapped inside this walls certain ideas take root such going home and bringing new concepts to this mass city. The results wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of ……. Finally free the butterfly shares lights on situations the caterpillar never considered. Ending the internal struggle. I thought about the caterpillar and the butterfly are completely different they are one and the same.  What’s your perception on that?
